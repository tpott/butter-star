Repository
----------

None of the static assets will be included with this repository,
due to git's way of handling blob files.

For our group's home page, check out [pisa](http://cse125.ucsd.edu/cse125/2013/cse125g3/)!

Realistically, we should make a butter\* user that has a *DustBusters* repository.
